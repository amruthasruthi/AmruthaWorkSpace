    <p> <span>JavaScript</span> is a powerful and widely used programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. 
        It runs directly in the browser, allowing developers to create responsive elements such as dropdown menus, form validations, animations, 
        and interactive data displays. JavaScript works alongside HTML and CSS to build complete web applications — HTML provides structure, CSS handles styling, 
        and JavaScript controls behavior. It is also used on the server side through environments like Node.js, making it a versatile language for both front-end 
        and back-end development. With its flexibility and large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, JavaScript plays a crucial role in modern web development.
